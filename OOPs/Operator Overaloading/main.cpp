    Operator Overloading in C++:

    1. **What is Operator Overloading?**
        - Operator overloading allows C++ operators to be redefined and used in different ways depending on the operand types.
        - It enhances the readability and usability of the code by allowing operators to work with user-defined types (classes).

    2. **Types of Operators that can be Overloaded:**
        - **Arithmetic Operators:** +, -, *, /, %
        - **Relational Operators:** ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
        - **Logical Operators:** &&, ||, !
        - **Bitwise Operators:** &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
        - **Assignment Operators:** =, +=, -=, *=, /=
        - **Increment/Decrement Operators:** ++, --
        - **Input/Output Operators:** <<, >>
        - **Indexing Operators:** []
        - **Function Call Operator:** ()
        - **Pointer Operators:** *, ->

    3. **Key Points:**
        - Operator overloading is performed by defining a function in the class with a special name.
        - You cannot change the precedence or associativity of operators.
        - Some operators cannot be overloaded (e.g., . , :: , .* , ?:).
        - Operator overloading can be done through member functions or friend functions.
        - Overloaded operators can also handle pointers and references.

          1. **When to use Member Functions:**
        - Use member functions to overload operators when:
            - The operator is naturally associated with the class.
            - The left operand is of the class type.
            - You don't need to access private or protected members of another class.

         2. **When to use Non-Member (Friend) Functions:**
            - Use non-member functions (friend functions) to overload operators when:
            - The left operand is not of the class type (e.g., when overloading operators for mixed-type operations).
            - You need to access private or protected members of other classes.
            - The operatorâ€™s functionality is more intuitive when defined outside the class.
